# FoodwishesRandomizer
A simple program that takes every recipe/and occasional random blog post from http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/ and randomly selects one.

An index will be created on first use and stored in your machine's "user.home" directory. This index can optionally be updated to include new content at your discretion.
